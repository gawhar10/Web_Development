				<header><h3>Introduction</h3></header>
				<p>C (/ˈsiː/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly for application software, and is common in computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.</p>
				<p>A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.[6] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages,[7][8] with C compilers available for almost[citation needed] all modern computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>
				<p>The C language also exhibits the following characteristics:
					<ul>
						<li>The language has a small, fixed number of keywords, including a full set of control flow primitives: if/else, for, do/while, while, and switch. User-defined names are not distinguished from keywords by any kind of sigil.</li>
						<li>It has a large number of arithmetic, bitwise, and logic operators: +,+=,++,&,||, etc.</li>
						<li>Data typing is static, but weakly enforced; all data has a type, but implicit conversions are possible.</li>
						<li>Low-level access to computer memory is possible by converting machine addresses to pointers.</li>
						<li>Memory can be allocated to a program with calls to library routines.</li>
					</ul>

			<section class="main-section" id="Variables_and_types">
				<header><h3>Variables and types</h3></header>
				<p>C is a statically typed language.

	This means that any variable has an associated type, and this type is known at compilation time.

	This is very different than how you work with variables in Python, JavaScript, PHP and other interpreted languages.

	When you create a variable in C, you have to specify the type of a variable at the declaration.</p>
				<p>In this example we initialize a variable age with type int:</p>
				<code><pre>int age;</pre></code>
				<p>You can also initialize a variable at declaration, specifying the initial value:</p>
				<code><pre>int age = 24;</pre></code>
				<p>Once you declare a variable, you are then able to use it in your program code.

In this case:</p>
<code>
<pre>
#include &ltstdio.h&gt

int main(void) {
    int age = 24;
    printf("%u", age);
}
</pre>
</code>
			</section>
			<section class="main-section" id="Constants">
				<header><h3>Constants</h3></header>
				<p>A constant is declared similarly to variables, except it is prepended with the const keyword, and you always need to specify a value.

Like this:</p>
				<p></p>
				<code>
<pre>
const int AGE = 37;
</pre>
				</code>
				<p>Another way to define constants is by using this syntax. In this case, you don't need to add a type, and you don't also need the = equal sign, and you omit the semicolon at the end.
				</p>
				<code>
<pre>
#define AGE 37
</pre>
				</code>
			</section>
			<section class="main-section" id="Operators">
				<header><h3>Operators</h3></header>
				<p>C offers us a wide variety of operators that we can use to operate on data.</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>arithmetic operators: =, +, -, *, /, %.</li>
						<li>comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=.</li>
						<li>logical operators: !, &&, ||.</li>
						<li>compound assignment operators: +=, -=, *=, /=, %=.</li>
						<li>bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>.</li>
					</ul>

			<section class="main-section" id="Conditionals">
				<header><h3>Conditionals</h3></header>
				<p>Any programming language provides the programmers the ability to perform choices.

We want to do X in some cases, and Y in other cases.

We want to check data, and make choices based on the state of that data.

C provides us 2 ways to do so.

The first is the if statement, with its else helper, and the second is the switch statement.</p>
				<h4>If-else Conditional.</h4>
				<p>if
In an if statement, you can check for a condition to be true, and then execute the block provided in the curly brackets. You can append an else block to execute a different block if the original condition turns out to be false:</p>
				<code>
<pre>
int a = 1;

if (a == 2) {
  /* do something */
} else {
  /* do something else */
}
</pre>
				</code>
				<p>You can have multiple else blocks by stacking together multiple if statements:</p>
				<code>
<pre>
int a = 1;

if (a == 2) {
  /* do something */
} else if (a == 1) {
  /* do something else */
} else {
  /* do something else again */
}
</pre>
				</code>
				<h4>Switch Conditional.</h4>
				<p>If you need to do too many if / else / if blocks to perform a check, perhaps because you need to check the exact value of a variable, then switch can be very useful to you.

You can provide a variable as condition, and a series of case entry points for each value you expect:</p>
               	<code>
<pre>
int a = 1;

switch (a) {
  case 0:
    /* do something */
    break;
  case 1:
    /* do something else */
    break;
  case 2:
    /* do something else */
    break;
}
</pre>
				</code>
				<p>We need a break keyword at the end of each case to avoid the next case being executed when the one before ends. This "cascade" effect can be useful in some creative ways.You can add a "catch-all" case at the end, labeled default:</p>
				<code>
<pre>
int a = 1;

switch (a) {
  case 0:
    /* do something */
    break;
  case 1:
    /* do something else */
    break;
  case 2:
    /* do something else */
    break;
  default:
    /* handle all the other cases */
    break;
}
</pre>
				</code>
				<h4>Loops Conditional.</h4>
				<p>C offers us three ways to perform a loop: for loops, while loops and do while loops. They all allow you to iterate over arrays, but with a few differences. Let's see them in detail.</p>
				<h5>For loops</h5>
				<p>The first and probably most common way to perform a loop is for loops.

Using the for keyword we can define the rules of the loop up front, and then provide the block that is going to be executed repeatedly.

Like this:</p>
			<code>
<pre>
for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  /* instructions to be repeated */
}
</pre>
			</code>
			<p>The (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) block contains 3 parts of the looping details:
				<ul>
					<li>the initial condition (int i = 0)</li>
					<li>the test (i <= 10)</li>
					<li>the increment (i++)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>This program should print 0 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8 9 10:</p>
			<code>
<pre>
for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  /* instructions to be repeated */
  printf("%u ", i);
}
</pre>
			</code>
			<h5>While loops</h5>
			<p>While loops is simpler to write than a for loop, because it requires a bit more work on your part.

Instead of defining all the loop data up front when you start the loop, like you do in the for loop, using while you just check for a condition:</p>
			<code>
<pre>
int i = 0;

while (i < 10) {
  /* do something */

  i++;
}
</pre>
			</code>
			<h5>Do while loops</h5>
			<p>While loops are great, but there might be times when you need to do one particular thing: you want to always execute a block, and then maybe repeat it.

This is done using the do while keyword. In a way it's very similar to a while loop, but slightly different:</p>
			<code>
<pre>
int i = 0;

do {
  /* do something */

  i++;
} while (i < 10);
</pre>
			</code>
			<p>The block that contains the /* do something */ comment is always executed at least once, regardless of the condition check at the bottom.

Then, until i is less than 10, we'll repeat the block.</p>
			<h5>Breaking out of a loop using break</h5>
			<p>In all the C loops we have a way to break out of a loop at any point  in time, immediately, regardless of the conditions set for the loop.

This is done using the break keyword.

This is useful in many cases. You might want to check for the value of a variable, for example:</p>
			<code>
<pre>
for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i == 4 && someVariable == 10) {
    break;
  }
}
</pre>
			</code>
			</section>
			<section class="main-section" id="Arrays">
				<header><h3>Arrays</h3></header>
				<p>An array is a variable that stores multiple values.

Every value in the array, in C, must have the same type. This means you will have arrays of int values, arrays of double values, and more.You must always specify the size of the array.

You can define an array of int values like this:</p>
				<code>
<pre>
int prices[5];
</pre>
				</code>
				<p>You can initialize an array at definition time, like this:</p>
				<code>
<pre>
int prices[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
</pre>
				</code>
				<p>But you can also assign a value after the definition, in this way:</p>
				<code>
<pre>
int prices[5];

prices[0] = 1;
prices[1] = 2;
prices[2] = 3;
prices[3] = 4;
prices[4] = 5;
</pre>
				</code>
				<p>And you can reference an item in the array by using square brackets after the array variable name, adding an integer to determine the index value.Array indexes start from 0, so an array with 5 items, like the prices array above, will have items ranging from prices[0] to prices[4]. Like this:</p>
				<code>
<pre>
prices[0]; /* array item value: 1 */
prices[1]; /* array item value: 2 */
</pre>
				</code>
			</section>
			<section class="main-section" id="Strings">
				<header><h3>Strings</h3></header>
				<p>In C, strings are one special kind of array: a string is an array of char values:</p>
				<code>
<pre>
char name[7];
</pre>
				</code>
				<p>A string can be initialized like you initialize a normal array:</p>
				<code>
<pre>
char name[7] = { "F", "l", "a",
                "v", "i", "o" };
</pre>
				</code>
				<p>Or more conveniently with a string literal (also called string constant), a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes:</p>
				<code>
<pre>
char name[7] = "Flavio";
</pre>
				</code>
				<p>You can print a string via printf() using %s:</p>
				<code>
<pre>
printf("%s", name);
</pre>
				</code>
				<p>Do you notice how "Flavio" is 6 chars long, but I defined an array of length 7? Why? This is because the last character in a string must be a  0 value, the string terminator, and we must make space for it.

This is important to keep in mind especially when manipulating strings.</p>

			<section class="main-section" id="Functions">
				<header><h3>Functions</h3></header>
				<p>The function body is the set of instructions that are executed any time we invoke a function.</p>
				<p>Functions are the way we can structure our code into subroutines that we can:</p>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>give a name to</li>
						<li>call when we need them</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>Starting from your very first program, a "Hello, World!", you immediately make use of C functions:</p>
				<code>
<pre>
#include &ltstdio.h&gt

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello, World!");
}
</pre>
				</code>
				<p>The main() function is a very important function, as it's the entry point for a C program.

Here's another function:</p>
			<code>
<pre>
void doSomething(int value) {
    printf("%u", value);
}
</pre>
			</code>
			<p>Functions have 4 important aspects:
				<ol>
					<li>they have a name, so we can invoke ("call") them later</li>
					<li>they specify a return value</li>
					<li>they can have arguments</li>
					<li>they have a body, wrapped in curly braces</li>
				</ol>
